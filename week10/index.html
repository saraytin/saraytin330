        <ul>
          <li>
            I think it's interesting that this lines up so closely with WDD331: Advanced CSS, which I'm taking
            concurrently.
          </li>
          <li>We're covering/just covered SVGs there, and translation and transformations as a part of it.</li>
          <li>
            Transitions are new to me, and it feels like the transition and animation shorthands are going to be yet
            another shorthand I have trouble remembered the order of.
          </li>
          <li>
            Animating things with native CSS seems really impressive and I can see the advantages, but I really hope I
            won't need to do anything particularly complex with it.
          </li>
          <li>
            I initially thought the Canvas stuff in JavaScript was going to be similar to SVGs in that they're cool in
            concept but kind of a headache to do anything complex without some external UI (at least, that's in my
            limited understanding), but the drawImage function (and those related to it) seems extremely useful and
            pretty easy to work with.
          </li>
          <li>I think it's unusual that "draggable" is not boolean when true as a value.</li>
