        <ul>
          <li>
            I know from another class that client-side validation can be bypassed fairly easily.
          </li>
          <li>
            I think client-side is better for helping the user fill out forms while server-side validation does the real work in ensuring correct inputs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Online tools that help in building and testing regexp patterns are super useful here.
          </li>
          <li>
            Value and length are easy, but once again need to be implemented on both sides.
          </li>
          <li>
            I don't much like the statement that "most" browsers support Constraint Validation API without any specifics (which MDN Web Docs often provide), but a quick <a href='https://caniuse.com/constraint-validation'>Google search</a> confirms that it's safe for any reasonably up to date browser release.
          </li>
          <li>
            I think using the Constraint Validation API will be easier with simple experience; it's hard to read documentation and actually remember it without using it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fetch is supported in pretty much the same releases as Constraint Validation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Something that I often have trouble with is finding the right number of ending parenthesis, brackets, etc. with all of the ".then()" and ".catch()" elements. I think a template call can be useful here.
          </li>
