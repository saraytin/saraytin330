            <ul>
                <li>I thought it was interesting that the portfolio instructions mentioned creating an 'ol' element in the HTML. It made more sense to me to make
                     it via js, like the 'li' and 'a' elements.
                </li>
                <li>The reading said "When you want to get the user’s input from any input or text area
                     tag, you use the special word ‘value.’ When you want to show
                     something to a user, you use a section (see Section 1) and the special word ‘innerHTML.’ So...if your dealing with
                     an input or textarea use value; a section, use innerHTML." <br>
                     It's something I intuitively learned through experience, but I have tripped up a few times on figuring out when to use value or innerHTML.
                     It's nice to see an explanation here.
                </li>
                <li>localStorage seems very limited in real world application if it only works on the same system that previously ran the app. It's one thing for
                     learning the ropes, but I would be surprised if real world developers use it much, or at least in the way shown.
